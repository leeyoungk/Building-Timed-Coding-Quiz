# Building-Timed-Coding-Quiz

Deployed Application: https://leeyoungk.github.io/Building-Timed-Coding-Quiz/
## Description

This project is creating a web application that would ask user list of questions and user would pick a correct answer from given answers. There is a time limited to answer the questions and every time an incorrect answer is picked, a certain amount of time will be subtract from the giving time. This is an interesting project but also required alot of researchs and testing the codes. Through out the project, i learnt how to start out with a pseudo code and break into smaller tasks from it. Although i didnt complete the project yet, but i will countiue working on it to finish the project.

## Installation 

first of all, i started out with a pseudo code
Then, started to write a briefly HTML page,css , and js.
in the js file, i created a golable variables , also an object to contain listofquestions.
After that, i set a varible timeLeft
Then,created a function to make the time run untill i hit 0 or when the quiz is over.
I created a lick eventlistener that when the button is clicked, the time would start running and questions will start to show up.

## Usage
This is how the page would look like.
